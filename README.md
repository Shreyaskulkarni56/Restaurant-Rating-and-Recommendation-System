Restaurant Rating Prediction, Recommendation and Analysis

      This project focuses on building a machine learning system that predicts restaurant ratings, recommends restaurants
      based on user preferences,and analyzes cuisine trends.It using multiple algorithms and data processing techniques to 
      deliver insights predictions.
Level 1
      
Steps:

    Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training 
    and testing sets.
    Select a regression algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision tree regression) and train it on the training data.
    Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate regression metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared) on the 
    testing data.
    Interpret the model's results and analyze the most influential features affecting restaurant ratings.
Level 2

Steps
    
    Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
    Determine the criteria for restaurant recommendations (e.g., cuisine preference, price range).
    Implement a content-based filtering approach where users are recommended restaurants similar to their preferred criteria.
    Test the recommendation system by providing sample user preferences and evaluating the quality of recommendations.

Level 3

Steps
    
    Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
    Split the data into training and testing sets.
    Select a classification algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) and train it on the training data.
    Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) on the testing data.
    Analyze the model's performance across different cuisines and identify any challenges or biases.
